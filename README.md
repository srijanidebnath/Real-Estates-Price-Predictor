# Real-Estates-Price-Predictor
This is a Machine Learning model used to predict the prices of real estates.

Key Features of the model:

In this project, I have used Supervised Learning concepts of Machine Learning to make this model predict the prices of real estates.

Features of the houses are given as input to this model which it uses to predict their actual prices.

This model can be used in solving real-life problems & consequences & can benefit Real Estates Companies in earning  profits.
